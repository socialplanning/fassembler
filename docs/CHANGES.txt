Fassembler changes
------------------

* Added a new `tasks.InstallSpecIfPresent` which checks if the path
  to the requirements spec is present on the filesystem, and does
  nothing if the file does not exist.

* `tasks.VirtualEnv(never_create_virtualenv=True)` no longer runs
  any subtasks.

* Added a new Task `fassembler.apache.CheckApache` which will check
  the presence a list of required Apache modules.  It must be called
  from a Project that subclasses `fassembler.apache.ApacheMixin`.

Project changes
---------------

* fassembler:topp now installs requirements/fassembler-req.txt into 
  the fassembler virtualenv if that file is present.  This file can
  specify add-on packages that provide additional fassembler projects
  to be used in the rest of the build.

  This action was previously done by the `rebuild-opencore-site` script
  in `opencore-fassembler_boot` and is being moved here for better
  encapsulation of builds.  (A build *should* be able to be run entirely
  from fassembler; opencore-fassembler_boot should just be a convenience
  package that wraps fassembler's more arcane knowledge.)

* Various configuration changes in fassembler:buildmaster and buildslave.

* fassembler:wordpress now checks for the presence of its required Apache
  modules, including the Apache PHP module.

* Bake in pinned requirements for opencore's i18ndude sub-project.

Fassembler changes
------------------

* Fassembler has hardcoded expectations that the user's $LANG is
  English -- Maker._get_repo_url parses an error message from
  Subversion with the assumption that it is in English. This manifests
  when running fassembler:topp while it runs `svn info` on the etc
  directory in a new build, which will exist as an unversioned
  directory.

  It now works if the user's $LANG is Spanish, as well.  But no other
  languages!

  Of course, this is extremely silly, and should be fixed more
  properly immediately.

* When installing a virtualenv, install setuptools 0.6c11 into the new
  virtualenv, always.  This prevents problems on systems whose
  virtualenv version installs the broken setuptools 0.6c8 by
  default. Symptoms: errors like "unrecognized format" and "global
  name 'log' is not defined".

* Fix sporadic bug in projects where ``use_pip=True``: "The expected
  executable ['pip', '-E', ...] was not found."  When
  ``use_pip=True``, Fassembler will now ``easy_install pip`` during
  virtualenv creation, and will add the ``virtualenv_bin_path`` to $PATH
  before trying to run ``pip``. This should guarantee that the
  executable ``pip`` can be found.

Project changes
---------------

* Add a boolean ``use_pip`` setting to fassembler:cabochon project. 
  Default fassembler:cabochon to use pip instead of easy_install,
  because it seems to work better here.

* Modify zeo skel's configuration to use {{env.var}}/zeo/zdsock (a
  unix socket) instead of a port for connections.  Modify zope skels'
  configuration to connect to zeo on {{env.var}}/zeo/zdsock as
  well. See
  http://www.coactivate.org/projects/opencore/lists/opencore-dev/archive/2010/07/1278617074321/forum_view

* The RunZopeScriptsWithZeo task now looks for a
  config.skip_zopectl_scripts setting.  If it is set to a True value,
  the task does nothing.  This can be used to prevent the build from
  hanging on this task if another ZEO instance is already running and
  the user knows that the zopectl initialization scripts don't need to
  be run, i.e. when building a code upgrade in parallel to a running
  site.

* The fassembler:maildrop and fassembler:zeo projects now include this
  skip_zopectl_scripts setting, with default 0.

* Add a setting ``supervisor_var`` to the supervisor project, which
  defaults to ``{{env.var}}/supervisor``.  This is used to build the
  paths to the Unix socket file and pidfile used by supervisor.  It
  can be useful to set this to a value other than
  ``{{env.var}}/supervisor`` if building an upgrade in parallel to a
  running site, so that both the old and the new supervisor processes
  can run simultaneously without interference.

* The extrazope project now runs ``python setup.py zinstall`` in the
  zcmlloader source directory to copy zcmlloader's zcml entrypoint
  into each additional Zope's package-includes.  (At some point soon
  opencore will stop using zcmlloader in favor of z3c.autoinclude, at
  which point these zinstalls won't be needed anymore.) 

* The extrazope project now creates a separate var directory for each
  instance and points to that directory in zope.conf for the
  instance's pidfile, lock file, etc.

0.5
===

* Add ``num_extra_zopes`` property to the environ object, which looks
  for a ``num_extra_zopes`` setting in the [general] section of
  build.ini and returns it as an integer or 0 if no such setting
  exists. 

* This setting will then be used to fill in the value of
  ``opencore_remote_uri`` in the Frontend configuration, allowing the
  frontend to proxy to a load-balanced set of Zope instances. 

* A ``num_extra_zopes`` setting has also been added to the
  fassembler:topp project, where it is saved to build.ini.

This is the first tag made for fassembler.  A lot happened before now 
but releases were never cut.

In this release:

* Added fassembler:extrazope project, which will build an additional
  Zope instance connected to the same ZEO server. 

* In fassembler:opencore, made the ``debug`` setting actually work, to
  control whether zope starts in debug mode when running
  ``./opencore/bin/zopectl fg`` (where it previously always ran with
  ``debug-mode=on``) or ``./bin/start-opencore`` (where it previously
  always ran with ``debug-mode=off``) 

* Added a setting ``never_create_virtualenv`` for
  fassembler.tasks.VirtualEnv, which, if set, makes that task act as
  an assertion of the given virtualenv's existence, so that a build
  can fail if the virtualenv hasn't already been created.
