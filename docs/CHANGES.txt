Add a boolean ``use_pip`` setting to fassembler:cabochon project. Default fassembler:cabochon to use pip instead of easy_install.

Modify zeo skel's configuration to use {{env.var}}/zeo/zdsock (a unix
socket) instead of a port for connections.  Modify zope skels'
configuration to connect to zeo on {{env.var}}/zeo/zdsock as well.

The RunZopeScriptsWithZeo task now looks for a
config.skip_zopectl_scripts setting.  If it is set to a True value,
the task does nothing.  This can be used to prevent the build from
hanging on this task if another ZEO instance is already running and
the user knows that the zopectl initialization scripts don't need to
be run, i.e. when building a code upgrade in parallel to a running
site.

The fassembler:maildrop and fassembler:zeo projects now include this
skip_zopectl_scripts setting, with default 0.

Add a setting ``supervisor_var`` to the supervisor project, which
defaults to ``{{env.var}}/supervisor``.  This is used to build the
paths to the Unix socket file and pidfile used by supervisor.  It can
be useful to set this to a value other than ``{{env.var}}/supervisor``
if building an upgrade in parallel to a running site, so that both the
old and the new supervisor processes can run simultaneously without
interference.

The extrazope project now runs ``python setup.py zinstall`` in the
zcmlloader source directory to copy zcmlloader's zcml entrypoint
into each additional Zope's package-includes.  (At some point soon
opencore will stop using zcmlloader in favor of z3c.autoinclude,
at which point these zinstalls won't be needed anymore.)

The extrazope project now creates a separate var directory for each
instance and points to that directory in zope.conf for the instance's
pidfile, lock file, etc.

Add ``num_extra_zopes`` property to the environ object, which looks
for a ``num_extra_zopes`` setting in the [general] section of
build.ini and returns it as an integer or 0 if no such setting exists.

This setting will then be used to fill in the value of
``opencore_remote_uri`` in the Frontend configuration, allowing the
frontend to proxy to a load-balanced set of Zope instances.

A ``num_extra_zopes`` setting has also been added to the fassembler:topp project, where it is saved to build.ini.

This is the first tag made for fassembler.  A lot happened before now but releases were never cut.

In this release:

* Added fassembler:extrazope project, which will build an additional Zope instance connected to the same ZEO server.

* In fassembler:opencore, made the ``debug`` setting actually work, to control whether zope starts in debug mode when running ``./opencore/bin/zopectl fg`` (where it previously always ran with ``debug-mode=on``) or ``./bin/start-opencore`` (where it previously always ran with ``debug-mode=off`)

* Added a setting ``never_create_virtualenv`` for fassembler.tasks.VirtualEnv, which, if set, makes that task act as an assertion of the given virtualenv's existence, so that a build can fail if the virtualenv hasn't already been created.
